This subdirectory contains the source for GNUplot, and for the GD library
(needed for GIF output from GNUPlot).  In order to build GNUPlot, you should
first build the GD library, and then GNUPlot.

Also in this directory is a patch for GNUPlot which increases the number of
available line styles - useful for plots that include a large number of items,
eg disks.  Use the "patch" utility to apply this patch if you require it.
