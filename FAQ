Here are some answers to questions I frequently get asked about StatsView

Q1.  What packages do I need to use it?

A.   Perl 5.005_03
     Gnuplot 3.7
     Perl Tk version 800.014
     Perl Tk::GBARR version 1.0401

Q2.  I have this vmstat/mpstat/iostat file I captured earlier, but StatsView
     doesn't seem to recognise it.  How do I view it with StatsView?

A.   These data files have no timestamp information in them, so StatsView
     doesn't know the interval between samples, or indeed when the sampling
     started.  It's therefore necessary to add a simple header to the data file
     before viewing it with StatsView.  This line should be the first line in
     the file, and should be in the format:

        Start: DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss Interval: sss

     where "Start" is the time that the sampling started, and "Interval" is the
     time between samples in seconds.

Q3.  I have a binary sar file I captured on system X, but I can't view it on
     system Y.  Why?

A.   This has nothing to do with StatsView per se.  The format of binary sar
     files is both architecture and OS release dependent.  StatsView just uses
     "sar -A -f" to convert the binary file to ASCII before processing it.  If
     the file was captured on a machine with a different architecture, or with
     a different OS reease it probably won't work.  As a workaround you can
     transfer the binary file to a compatible machine, run
     "sar -A -f sar.dat > sar.txt", transfer the text file to the machine with
     StatsView on and pass the text file to StatsView.  A better solution is
     not to capture binary sar files in the first place - they are both
     non-portable and significantly bigger than the text versions.
