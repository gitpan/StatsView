This directory contains a simple example of the script interface to StatsView.

Note that you will have to have compiled gnuplot with the optional gd (GIF)
graphics support for this example to work - If you havn't you can change the
output format to something else - postscript or csv, for example.

To run the example, firstly unzip the sar.txt.gz file in this directory, then
modify the first line of the "sargif" script to invoke the perl interpreter on
your machine.  You can then run the "sargif" script.  If you want to try this
before installing the StatsView package, run the script using
"perl -Mblib sargif".

When the script has run you will be left with four GIF files in the current
directory.
