StatsView Version 0.6 beta
==========================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

StatsView is a GUI-based tool for viewing the output of the various utilities
that produce system performance statistics.  At the moment sar, iostat, vmstat
and vxstat are supported.  In this release the ability to collect statistics has
been added, including the collection and display of Oracle statistics.
Suggestions for other statistic types are welcome!

StatsView offers the following features:

o Allows multiple data sources and graphs to be displayed simultaneously
o Supports both printing and saving of the graphs in a wide range of
  formats: Postscript, CGM, (Microsoft Office), MIF (FrameMaker), GIF and as a
  CSV - useful for extracting data from sar files!
o Supports both binary (sar -o) and text (sar > file) sar data files.
o Allows the selection of which category of sar data is to be viewed, e.g.
  CPU, Paging, Disk I/O etc.
o Within a category, it allows the selection of individual data items, e.g.
  for CPU data %usr, %sys, %wio and %idle are individually selectable.
o Supports iostat -x and vmstsat output, providing a header line is added to
  the start of the file (see below).
o Has a GUI interface for statistics collection, allowing all the supported
  statistics to be collected in an ingegrated manner.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

StatsView is written in Perl5, using the Perl Tk extension library.  I recommend
that you use perl5.005_02 or later, and Tk800.012 or later, as StatsView has
been tested with these versions.

The graphing is done with gnuplot, and version  3.6 beta or later is required -
a copy can be found in the gnuplot_src subdirectory.

INSTALLATION
------------

1.  Check you have all the prequisites installed and working.
2.  perl Makefile.PL; make install
3.  run "sv" or "sv <stats file>" to get started.
